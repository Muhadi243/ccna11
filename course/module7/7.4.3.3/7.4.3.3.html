        <h2>Why Use Link-State Routing Protocols</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>There are only two link-state routing protocols, OSPF and IS-IS.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is the most popular implementation. It was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) OSPF Working Group. The development of OSPF began in 1987 and there are two current versions in use:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>OSPFv2<b></b>- OSPF for IPv4 networks (RFC 1247 and RFC 2328)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>OSPFv3<b></b>- OSPF for IPv6 networks (RFC 2740)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: With the OSPFv3 Address Families feature, OSPFv3 includes support for both IPv4 and IPv6.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>IS-IS was designed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and is described in ISO 10589. The first incarnation of this routing protocol was developed at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and is known as DECnet Phase V. Radia Perlman was the chief designer of the IS-IS routing protocol.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>IS-IS was originally designed for the OSI protocol suite and not the TCP/IP protocol suite. Later, Integrated IS-IS, or Dual IS-IS, included support for IP networks. Although IS-IS has been known as the routing protocol used mainly by ISPs and carriers, more enterprise networks are beginning to use IS-IS.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>OSPF and IS-IS share many similarities and also have many differences. There are many pro-OSPF and pro-IS-IS factions who discuss and debate the advantages of one routing protocol over the other. Both routing protocols provide the necessary routing functionality. </p>
