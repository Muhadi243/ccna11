          <p>Switches use MAC addresses to direct network communications through the switch to the appropriate port toward the destination. A switch is made up of integrated circuits and the accompanying software that controls the data paths through the switch. For a switch to know which port to use to transmit a frame, it must first learn which devices exist on each port. As the switch learns the relationship of ports to devices, it builds a table called a MAC address, or content addressable memory (CAM) table.  CAM is a special type of memory used in high-speed searching applications.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>LAN switches determine how to handle incoming data frames by maintaining the MAC address table. A switch builds its MAC address table by recording the MAC address of each device connected to each of its ports. The switch uses the information in the MAC address table to send frames destined for a specific device out the port which has been assigned to that device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A switch populates the MAC address table based on source MAC addresses. When a switch receives an incoming frame with a destination MAC address that is not found in the MAC address table, the switch forwards the frame out of all ports (flooding) except for the ingress port of the frame.  When the destination device responds, the switch adds the source MAC address of the frame and the port where the frame was received to the MAC address table. In networks with multiple interconnected switches, the MAC address table contains multiple MAC addresses for a single port connected to the other switches.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following steps describe the process of building the MAC address table:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. The switch receives a frame from PC 1 on Port 1 (Figure 1).</p>
          <p>2. The switch examines the source MAC address and compares it to MAC address table.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the address is not in the MAC address table, it associates the source MAC address of PC 1 with the ingress port (Port 1) in the MAC address table (Figure 2).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the MAC address table already has an entry for that source address, it resets the aging timer. An entry for a MAC address is typically kept for five minutes.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>3. After the switch has recorded the source address information, the switch examines the destination MAC address. </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the destination address is not in the MAC table or if itâ€™s a broadcast MAC address, as indicated by all Fs, the switch floods the frame to all ports, except the ingress port (Figure 3).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>4. The destination device (PC 3) replies to the frame with a unicast frame addressed to PC 1 (Figure 4).</p>
          <p>5. The switch enters the source MAC address of PC 3 and the port number of the ingress port into the address table. The destination address of the frame and its associated egress port is found in the MAC address table (Figure 5).</p>
          <p>6. The switch can now forward frames between these source and destination devices without flooding, because it has entries in the address table that identify the associated ports (Figure 6).</p>
