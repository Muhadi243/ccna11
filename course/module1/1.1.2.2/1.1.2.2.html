        <h2>Switched Networks</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>There are various types of switches used in business networks. It is important to deploy the appropriate types of switches based on network requirements. Figure 1 highlights some common business considerations when selecting switch equipment.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When selecting the type of switch, the network designer must choose between a fixed or a modular configuration, and stackable or non-stackable. Another consideration is the thickness of the switch, which is expressed in number of rack units. This is important for switches that are mounted in a rack. For example, the fixed configuration switches shown in Figure 2 are all 1 rack unit (1U). These options are sometimes referred to as switch form factors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Fixed Configuration Switches</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Fixed configuration switches do not support features or options beyond those that originally came with the switch (Figure 2). The particular model determines the features and options available. For example, a 24-port gigabit fixed switch cannot support additional ports. There are typically different configuration choices that vary in how many and what types of ports are included with a fixed configuration switch.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Modular Configuration Switches</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Modular configuration switches offer more flexibility in their configuration. Modular configuration switches typically come with different sized chassis that allow for the installation of different numbers of modular line cards (Figure 3). The line cards actually contain the ports. The line card fits into the switch chassis the way that expansion cards fit into a PC. The larger the chassis, the more modules it can support. There can be many different chassis sizes to choose from. A modular switch with a 24-port line card supports an additional 24 port line card, to bring the total number of ports up to 48. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Stackable Configuration Switches</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Stackable configuration switches can be interconnected using a special cable that provides high-bandwidth throughput between the switches (Figure 4). Cisco StackWise technology allows the interconnection of up to nine switches. Switches can be stacked one on top of the other with cables connecting the switches in a daisy chain fashion. The stacked switches effectively operate as a single larger switch. Stackable switches are desirable where fault tolerance and bandwidth availability are critical and a modular switch is too costly to implement. Using cross-connected connections, the network can recover quickly if a single switch fails. Stackable switches use a special port for interconnections. Many Cisco stackable switches also support StackPower technology, which enables power sharing among stack members.</p>
