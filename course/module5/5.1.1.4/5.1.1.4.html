        <h1>Inter-VLAN Routing Configuration</h1>
        <h2>Inter-VLAN Routing Operation</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>The router-on-a-stick implementation of inter-VLAN routing requires only one physical interface on a router and one interface on a switch, simplifying the cabling of the router. However, in other implementations of inter-VLAN routing, a dedicated router is not required.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Multilayer switches can perform Layer 2 and Layer 3 functions, replacing the need for dedicated routers to perform basic routing on a network. Multilayer switches support dynamic routing and inter-VLAN routing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click the Play button in the figure to see an animation of how switch-based inter-VLAN routing occurs. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As seen in the animation:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. PC1 on VLAN 10 is communicating with PC3 on VLAN 30 through switch S1 using VLAN interfaces configured for each VLAN.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>2. PC1 sends its unicast traffic to switch S2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>3. Switch S2 tags the unicast traffic as originating on VLAN 10 as it forwards the unicast traffic out its trunk link to switch S1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>4. Switch S1 removes the VLAN tag and forwards the unicast traffic to the VLAN 10 interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>5. Switch S1 routes the unicast traffic to its VLAN 30 interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>6. Switch S1 then retags the unicast traffic with VLAN 30 and forwards it out the trunk link back to switch S2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>7. Switch S2 removes the VLAN tag of the unicast frame and forwards the frame out to PC3 on port F0/6.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To enable a multilayer switch to perform routing functions, the multilayer switch must have IP routing enabled.</p>
          <p>Multilayer switching is more scalable than any other inter-VLAN routing implementation. This is because routers have a limited number of available ports to connect to networks. Additionally, for interfaces that are configured as a trunk line, limited amounts of traffic can be accommodated on that line at one time.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With a multilayer switch, traffic is routed internal to the switch device, which means packets are not filtered down a single trunk line to obtain new VLAN-tagging information. A multilayer switch does not, however, completely replace the functionality of a router. Routers support a significant number of additional features, such as the ability to implement greater security controls. Rather, a multilayer switch can be thought of as a Layer 2 device that is upgraded to have some routing capabilities. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: <b></b>In this course, configuring inter-VLAN routing on a switch is restricted to configuring static routes on a 2960 switch, which is the only routing functionality supported on the 2960 switches. The 2960 switch supports up to 16 static routes (including user-configured routes and the default route) and any directly connected routes and default routes for the management interface; the 2960 switch can have an IP address assigned to each switch virtual interface (SVI). For a full-featured, relatively inexpensive multilayer switch, the Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series switches support the EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP routing protocols.</p>
