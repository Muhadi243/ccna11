        <h1>Characteristics of OSPF</h1>
        <h2>OSPF Operation</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>When OSPF is enabled on an interface, the router must determine if there is another OSPF neighbor on the link. To accomplish this, the router forwards a Hello packet that contains its router ID out all OSPF-enabled interfaces. The OSPF router ID is used by the OSPF process to uniquely identify each router in the OSPF area. A router ID is an IP address assigned to identify a specific router among OSPF peers. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a neighboring OSPF-enabled router receives a Hello packet with a router ID that is not within its neighbor list, the receiving router attempts to establish an adjacency with the initiating router. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Refer to R1 in Figure 1. When OSPF is enabled, the enabled Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 interface transitions from the Down state to the Init state. R1 starts sending Hello packets out all OSPF-enabled interfaces to discover OSPF neighbors to develop adjacencies with. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 2, R2 receives the Hello packet from R1 and adds the R1 router ID to its neighbor list. R2 then sends a Hello packet to R1. The packet contains the R2 Router ID and the R1 Router ID in its list of neighbors on the same interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 3, R1 receives the Hello and adds the R2 Router ID in its list of OSPF neighbors. It also notices its own Router ID in the Hello packetâ€™s list of neighbors. When a router receives a Hello packet with its Router ID listed in the list of neighbors, the router transitions from the Init state to the Two-Way state. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The action performed in Two-Way state depends on the type of inter-connection between the adjacent routers:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the two adjacent neighbors are interconnected over a point-to-point link, then they immediately transition from the Two-Way state to the database synchronization phase.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the routers are interconnected over a common Ethernet network, then a designated router DR and a BDR must be elected.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because R1 and R2 are interconnected over an Ethernet network, a DR and BDR election takes place. As shown in Figure 4, R2 becomes the DR and R1 is the BDR. This process only occurs on multi-access networks such as Ethernet LANs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Hello packets are continually exchanged to maintain router information.</p>
