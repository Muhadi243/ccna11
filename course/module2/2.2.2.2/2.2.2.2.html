          <p>DHCP is the protocol that automatically assigns a host a valid IP address out of a DHCP pool. DHCP has been in use for nearly as long as TCP/IP has been the main protocol used within industry for allocating clients IP addresses. Two types of DHCP attacks can be performed against a switched network: DHCP starvation attacks and DHCP spoofing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In DHCP starvation attacks, an attacker floods the DHCP server with DHCP requests to use up all the available IP addresses that the DHCP server can issue. After these IP addresses are issued, the server cannot issue any more addresses, and this situation produces a denial-of-service (DoS) attack as new clients cannot obtain network access. A DoS attack is any attack that is used to overload specific devices and network services with illegitimate traffic, thereby preventing legitimate traffic from reaching those resources.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In DHCP spoofing attacks, an attacker configures a fake DHCP server on the network to issue DHCP addresses to clients. The normal reason for this attack is to force the clients to use false Domain Name System (DNS) or Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) servers and to make the clients use the attacker, or a machine under the control of the attacker, as their default gateway. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>DHCP starvation is often used before a DHCP spoofing attack to deny service to the legitimate DHCP server, making it easier to introduce a fake DHCP server into the network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To mitigate DHCP attacks, use the DHCP snooping and port security features on the Cisco Catalyst switches. These features are covered in a later topic.</p>
