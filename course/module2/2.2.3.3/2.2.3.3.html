        <h1>Switch Security: Management and Implementation</h1>
        <h2>Security Best Practices</h2>

      <div id="content">
          <p>Network security tools allow a network administrator to perform a security audit of a network. A security audit reveals the type of information an attacker can gather simply by monitoring network traffic. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, network security auditing tools allow an administrator to flood the MAC address table with fictitious MAC addresses. This is followed by an audit of the switch ports as the switch starts flooding traffic out of all ports. During the audit, the legitimate MAC address mappings are aged out and replaced with fictitious MAC address mappings. This determines which ports are compromised and not correctly configured to prevent this type of attack.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Timing is an important factor in performing the audit successfully. Different switches support varying numbers of MAC addresses in their MAC table. It can be difficult to determine the ideal amount of spoofed MAC addresses to send to the switch. A network administrator also has to contend with the age-out period of the MAC address table. If the spoofed MAC addresses start to age out while performing a network audit, valid MAC addresses start to populate the MAC address table, and limiting the data that can be monitored with a network auditing tool.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network security tools can also be used for penetration testing against a network. Penetration testing is a simulated attack against the network to determine how vulnerable it would be in a real attack. This allows a network administrator to identify weaknesses within the configuration of networking devices and make changes to make the devices more resilient to attacks. There are numerous attacks that an administrator can perform, and most tool suites come with extensive documentation detailing the syntax needed to execute the desired attack. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because penetration tests can have adverse effects on the network, they are carried out under very controlled conditions, following documented procedures detailed in a comprehensive network security policy. An off-line test bed network that mimics the actual production network is the ideal. The test bed network can be used by networking staff to perform network penetration tests.</p>
