        <h2>Purpose of ACLs</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>ACLs define the set of rules that give added control for packets that enter inbound interfaces, packets that relay through the router, and packets that exit outbound interfaces of the router. ACLs do not act on packets that originate from the router itself. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>ACLs are configured to apply to inbound traffic or to apply to outbound traffic as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Inbound ACLs </b>- Incoming packets are processed before they are routed to the outbound interface. An inbound ACL is efficient because it saves the overhead of routing lookups if the packet is discarded. If the packet is permitted by the tests, it is then processed for routing. Inbound ACLs are best used to filter packets when the network attached to an inbound interface is the only source of the packets needed to be examined.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Outbound ACLs </b>- Incoming packets are routed to the outbound interface, and then they are processed through the outbound ACL. Outbound ACLs are best used when the same filter will be applied to packets coming from multiple inbound interfaces before exiting the same outbound interface. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The last statement of an ACL is always an implicit deny. This statement is automatically inserted at the end of each ACL even though it is not physically present. The implicit deny blocks all traffic. Because of this implicit deny, an ACL that does not have at least one permit statement will block all traffic.</p>
