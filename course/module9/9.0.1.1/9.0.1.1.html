          <p>Network security is a huge subject, and much of it is far beyond the scope of this course. However, one of the most important skills a network administrator needs is mastery of access control lists (ACLs). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network designers use firewalls to protect networks from unauthorized use. Firewalls are hardware or software solutions that enforce network security policies. Consider a lock on a door to a room inside a building. The lock allows only authorized users with a key or access card to pass through the door. Similarly, a firewall filters unauthorized or potentially dangerous packets from entering the network. On a Cisco router, you can configure a simple firewall that provides basic traffic filtering capabilities using ACLs. Administrators use ACLs to stop traffic or permit only specified traffic on their networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An ACL is a sequential list of permit or deny statements that apply to addresses or upper-layer protocols. ACLs provide a powerful way to control traffic into and out of a network. ACLs can be configured for all routed network protocols. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The most important reason to configure ACLs is to provide security for a network. This chapter explains how to use standard and extended ACLs on a Cisco router as part of a security solution. Included are tips, considerations, recommendations, and general guidelines on how to use ACLs. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter includes an opportunity to develop your mastery of ACLs with a series of lessons, activities, and lab exercises.</p>
