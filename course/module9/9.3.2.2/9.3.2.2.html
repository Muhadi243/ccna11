      <div id="content">
          <p>In the previous example, the network administrator configured an ACL to allow users from the 192.168.10.0/24 network to browse both insecure and secure websites. Even though it has been configured, the ACL will not filter traffic until it is applied to an interface. To apply an ACL to an interface, first consider whether the traffic to be filtered is going in or out. When a user on the internal LAN accesses a website on the Internet, traffic is traffic going out to the Internet. When an internal user receives an email from the Internet, traffic is coming into the local router. However, when applying an ACL to an interface, in and out take on different meanings. From an ACL consideration, in and out are in reference to the router interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the topology in the figure, R1 has three interfaces. It has a serial interface, S0/0/0, and two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, G0/0 and G0/1. Recall that an extended ACL should typically be applied close to the source. In this topology the interface closest to the source of the target traffic is the G0/0 interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Web request traffic from users on the 192.168.10.0/24 LAN is inbound to the G0/0 interface. Return traffic from established connections to users on the LAN is outbound from the G0/0 interface. The example applies the ACL to the G0/0 interface in both directions. The inbound ACL, 103, checks for the type of traffic. The outbound ACL, 104, checks for return traffic from established connections. This will restrict 192.168.10.0 Internet access to allow only website browsing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The access lists could have been applied to the S0/0/0 interface but in that case, the routerâ€™s ACL process would have to examine all packets entering the router, not only traffic to and from 192.168.11.0. This would cause unnecessary processing by the router.</p>
